Small project to explore some ML algorithms for classification.


 ##Classic Classifier
 
 Random forests, Naive Bayes, SVM all deliver around 70% accuracy. A grid search for SVM delivered an accuracy of aroudn 76%. 
 Thus, these classifiers don't perform very well on the data set.
 
 ##Building a neural network
 
 I use tensorflow to build a simple neural network with ? layers [TODO]
